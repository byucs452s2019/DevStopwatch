# Developer's Stopwatch

###### Track time spent working across projects, languages, and frameworks

With the ever-increasing variety of *ways* to program, it's more important than ever to keep track of where your time is going and where your skills are developing. Developer's Stopwatch aims to provide an elegant way to track how you spend your time in a more expressive metric than simply 'projects completed' or 'lines of code written.'



I'm looking to work in a small group (1-2 people) to keep development streamlined.



## Business

This application will be developed as a productivity tool, available for free as a limited-use web app and later as a one-time cost mobile application.



## Legal

Project code will be hosted in a public repository and be open-source under the MIT license.



## Technical

Developer's Stopwatch will use a SQLite backend database storing user credentials, project groups, and time logged, with an eye towards migrating to a document-based NoSQL database later on.
